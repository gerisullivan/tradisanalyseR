# tradisanalyseR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

tradisanalyseR was developed as a collection of scripts to further
analyse output produced by the Bio-TraDIS toolkit
(<https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-Tradis>). It takes the
resulting csv files for any number of conditions and formats it for use
in these scripts. This is a work-in-progress. Please email Geri at
<geraldine.sullivan@hdr.mq.edu.au> if you have any reproducibility
issues.
